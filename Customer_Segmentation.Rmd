## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
df <- read.csv('./Customer_Data.csv')
df
```

## EDA

```{r}
sum(is.na(df))
```

There are 24 NULL values in our data we will examine those as we go along

```{r}
df[duplicated(df)]
```

There are no duplicate rows

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  select(-ID)
```

#### Birth Year

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=Year_Birth))+ 
     geom_histogram(color = "grey", fill = "#1f77b4", bins = 30)+
  labs(x = "Year of Birth",
       y = "count", 
       title = "Distribution of Birth Year")+
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(Year_Birth < 1930)
```

seems like they are erroneous entries

#### Marital Status

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(Marital_Status)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#1f77b7", alpha = 0.8) + 
  labs( x= "Marital Status",
        y = "count",
        title = "Frequency plot for marital status")+
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Income

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Income)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "#1f77b7", alpha = 0.8)+ 
  labs(x = "Income",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of Income")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(5000, 100000, by=  40000))+
  theme_minimal()
```

There is an outlier in data where we see a very large income, to see the distribution clearly lets filter our data

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(Income < 500000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Income)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "#1f77b7", alpha = 0.8)+ 
  labs(x = "Income",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of Income")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(5000, 200000, by=  20000))+
  theme_minimal()
```

There are few data points with income greater than 85000 lets call them high income group while rest looks to in the range 19000 - 70000

```{r fig.width=20}
ggplot(df, aes(x = "", y = Income)) + 
  geom_violin(fill = "#69b3a2", color = "#e9ecef", alpha = 0.8)+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(5000, 165000, by=  40000))+
  labs(
    x = "Income",
    y = "Distribution",
    title = "Income Distribution"
  )+
  theme_minimal(base_size  = 20)

```

## Inspecting the missing data

```{r}
df[!complete.cases(df),]
```

```{r}
summary(df)
```

The missing values seems to have occurred at random as there are 24 missing values which is 1% of the total data, we can omit those values.

```{r}
df <- na.omit(df)
sum(is.na(df))
```

Formatting Date column

```{r}
df %>% 
  select(Dt_Customer)
```

```{r}
df<- df %>% 
  mutate(Dt_Customer = gsub("/", "-", Dt_Customer))
```

```{r}
df<- df %>% 
  mutate(Dt_Customer = as.Date(Dt_Customer, format("%d-%m-%Y")))
```

```{r}
summary(df$Dt_Customer)
```

Calculating Ages by taking the maximum Date

#### Age

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(Age = 2014 - Year_Birth)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#1f77b7", bins = 40, alpha = 0.8) + 
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = "count",
       title = "Distribution of Age")
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(Income != 666666) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Income) )+
geom_point(color = "#0072B2", size = 2)+
theme_minimal()
```

There is no any evident pattern

Removing Ouliter from data for Income and capping max age to 70

```{r}
df<- df %>% 
  filter(Income != 666666) %>% 
  mutate(Age = ifelse(Age > 70, 70, Age))
```

#### Checking Correlation between amount of product bought

```{r}
df_product <- df[,c("MntWines","MntFruits", "MntMeatProducts", "MntFishProducts", "MntSweetProducts", "MntGoldProds")]
```

```{r}

library(ggcorrplot)

corr_mat_products <- cor(df_product)

ggcorrplot(corr_mat_products, hc.order = TRUE) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.8)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = value)) +
  ggtitle("Correlation Plot for Product bought")
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggpairs(df_product) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

No significant relation Present between products

```{r}
df_gateway <- df[,c("NumDealsPurchases", "NumStorePurchases", "NumWebPurchases", "NumCatalogPurchases", "NumWebVisitsMonth")]
```

```{r}
corr_mat_gtwy <- cor(df_gateway)

ggcorrplot(corr_mat_gtwy, hc.order = TRUE) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.8)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = value)) +
  ggtitle("Correlation Plot of Sample Data")

df_campaign <- df[,c("AcceptedCmp1", "AcceptedCmp2", "AcceptedCmp3", "AcceptedCmp4", "AcceptedCmp5")]
corr_mat_campaign <- cor(df_campaign)

```

```{r, message=FALSE}
ggpairs(df_gateway) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

No Significant Relation present

```{r}
ggcorrplot(corr_mat_campaign, hc.order = TRUE) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.8)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = value)) +
  ggtitle("Correlation Plot of Sample Data")
```

#### Now we examine relation across various columns

Creating variable Total Purchase which has all product purchased

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(Total_Purchaase = MntWines + MntFruits + MntMeatProducts + MntFishProducts + MntSweetProducts + MntSweetProducts + MntGoldProds)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Marital_Status) %>% 
  summarise(Total_Purchase_by_Marital = mean(Total_Purchaase)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Marital_Status, y = Total_Purchase_by_Marital)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#1f77b7") + 
  theme_minimal()
  
```

We see a graph equivalent to the proportion of the population so there is no particular group purchasing more.

Now we see across each product

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Marital_Status) %>% 
  summarise(Total_Purchase_by_Marital = sum(Total_Purchaase)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Marital_Status, y = Total_Purchase_by_Marital)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#1f77b7") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Marital_Status) %>% 
  summarise(Wines = mean(MntWines), Fruits = mean(MntFruits), Meat = mean(MntMeatProducts), Fish = mean(MntFishProducts), Sweet = mean(MntSweetProducts), gold = mean(MntGoldProds)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Marital_Status)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Wines, fill = "Wines"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Fruits, fill = "Fruits"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Meat, fill = "Meat"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Fish, fill = "Fish"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Sweet, fill = "Sweet"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = gold, fill = "Gold"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Wines" = "#1F77B4", "Fruits" = "#FF7F0E", "Meat" = "#2CA02C", "Fish" = "#D62728", "Sweet" = "#9467BD", "Gold" = "#8C564B")) +
  labs(title = "Average Spending on Product Categories by Marital Status",
       x = "Marital Status",
       y = "Average Spending",
       fill = "Type of Product")+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

Wine is most common entity bought

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Income) %>% 
  summarise(Total_Purchase_by_Marital = mean(Total_Purchaase)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Income, y = Total_Purchase_by_Marital)) +
  geom_point(color = "#1f77b7", size = 2) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

We see a non-linear relationship between Income and Total Purchase

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Income) %>% 
  summarise(Wines = mean(MntWines), Fruits = mean(MntFruits), Meat = mean(MntMeatProducts), Fish = mean(MntFishProducts), Sweet = mean(MntSweetProducts), gold = mean(MntGoldProds)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Income)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Wines, color = "Wines"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Fruits, color = "Fruits"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Meat, color = "Meat"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Fish, color = "Fish"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Sweet, color = "Sweet"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = gold, color = "Gold Prods"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Products", values = c("Wines" = "#E69F00", "Fruits" = "#56B4E9", "Meat" = "#009E73", "Fish" = "#0072B2", "Sweet" = "#D55E00", "Gold Prods" = "#CC79A7")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

Wine is the most popular followed by by meat for average income households.

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Age) %>% 
  summarise(Wines = mean(MntWines), Fruits = mean(MntFruits), Meat = mean(MntMeatProducts), Fish = mean(MntFishProducts), Sweet = mean(MntSweetProducts), gold = mean(MntGoldProds)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Wines, color = "Wines"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Fruits, color = "Fruits"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Meat, color = "Meat"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Fish, color = "Fish"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Sweet, color = "Sweet"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(y = gold, color = "Gold Prods"), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Products", values = c("Wines" = "#E69F00", "Fruits" = "#56B4E9", "Meat" = "#009E73", "Fish" = "#0072B2", "Sweet" = "#D55E00", "Gold Prods" = "#CC79A7")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

Wine consumption increases over age. Whereas we see meat consumption beign high in early ages.

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(Education) %>% 
  summarise(Wines = mean(MntWines), Fruits = mean(MntFruits), Meat = mean(MntMeatProducts), Fish = mean(MntFishProducts), Sweet = mean(MntSweetProducts), gold = mean(MntGoldProds)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Education)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Wines, fill = "Wines"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Fruits, fill = "Fruits"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Meat, fill = "Meat"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Fish, fill = "Fish"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Sweet, fill = "Sweet"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = gold, fill = "Gold"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Wines" = "#1F77B4", "Fruits" = "#FF7F0E", "Meat" = "#2CA02C", "Fish" = "#D62728", "Sweet" = "#9467BD", "Gold" = "#8C564B")) +
  labs(title = "Average Spending on Product Categories by Education",
       x = "Education",
       y = "Average Spending",
       fill = "Type of Product")+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

PhDs consume more wine also the fact they are older validates the the relation with age

## Feature Engineering

We Create following features for Data Modelling

1.  Age (already Created)
2.  Total Purchase (Already Created) : Spending sum on all goods
3.  Is_Parent: If customer has kids home
4.  Education: Undergraduate, Graduate, Post-Graduate
5.  Has_Partner: If living with someone.
6.  Family Size:
7.  Active Days: Number of days since enrollment to last buys.
8.  Campaign: If Participated in campaign.

```{r}
df %>% 
  select(Kidhome, Teenhome)
```

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(Is_Parent = ifelse(Kidhome + Teenhome > 0, 1, 0)) 
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Is_Parent, y = Total_Purchaase)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#1f77b7")+
  theme_minimal()

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Is_Parent) ) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#1f77b7")+
  theme_minimal()

```

We see parents who have kids have spent relative more given then proportion in data.

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(Education = case_when(
    Education == "Basic" ~ "Undergraduate",
    Education == "2n Cycle" ~ "Undergraduate",
    Education == "Graduation" ~ "Graduate",
    Education == "Master" ~ "Postgraduate",
    Education == "PhD" ~ "Postgraduate",
    TRUE ~ Education  # Keep the original value if none of the above conditions match
  ))
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Education, y = Total_Purchaase)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#1f77b7")+
  theme_minimal()


df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Education)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(Has_Partner = case_when(
    Marital_Status %in% c("Married", "Together") ~ 1,
    Marital_Status %in% c("Absurd", "Widow", "YOLO", "Divorced", "Single", "Alone") ~ 0
  ))
```

```{r}
df$Teenhome <- as.integer(df$Teenhome)
df$Kidhome <- as.integer(df$Kidhome)
df$Has_Partner <- as.integer(df$Has_Partner)
```

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(Family_Size = Kidhome + Teenhome + Has_Partner)
```

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(campaign_participation = ifelse(AcceptedCmp3 + AcceptedCmp1 + AcceptedCmp2 + AcceptedCmp4 + AcceptedCmp5 + Response > 0, 1,0) )
```

```{r}
features <- df %>% 
  select(Age, Has_Partner, Is_Parent, Family_Size, Education, Income, Recency, campaign_participation, Total_Purchaase
         )
```

```{r}
features
```

```{r}
str(features)
```

```{r}
features$Education <- as.integer(factor(features$Education, levels = c("Postgraduate","Graduate", "Undergraduate")))
```

```{r}
features
```

## PCA

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(features, scale = TRUE)
```

```{r}
pca
```

```{r}
screeplot(pca)
```

```{r}
pr.var <- pca$sdev^2
pve <- 100 * pr.var/ sum(pr.var)
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(pve, xlab = "Principal Component",
    ylab = "Proportion of Variance Explained",
    type = "b")
plot(cumsum(pve), xlab = "Principal Component",
    ylab = "Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained",
     type = "b")
```

3 Principle component is good choice as it contributes to about 69% of the variation and there is an elbow point at 3,

## Clustering

```{r}
library(plotly)

p <- plot_ly(x = pca$x[,1], y = pca$x[,2], z = pca$x[,3], type = "scatter3d",
              mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "PC1"), yaxis = list(title = "PC2"),
                       zaxis = list(title = "PC3")))

# Display the plot
p

```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
fviz_nbclust(pca$x[,1:3], kmeans, method = "wss",k.max=10, nstart=20, iter.max=20) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 4, linetype = 4)+
  labs(subtitle = "Elbow method")
```

```{r message = False}
set.seed(1)
gap_kmeans <- clusGap(pca$x[,1:3], kmeans, nstart = 20, K.max = 10, B = 100)

plot(gap_kmeans, main = "Gap Statistic: kmeans")
```

So, 4 seems like a good choice as the values post that do not add much to the curves.

```{r}
km <- kmeans(pca$x[,1:3], 4)
```

```{r}
# Add cluster assignment to the pca object
pca$cluster <- as.factor(km$cluster)


p <- plot_ly(x = pca$x[,1], y = pca$x[,2], z = pca$x[,3], type = "scatter3d",
              mode = "markers", color = pca$cluster) %>%
  layout(scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "PC1"), yaxis = list(title = "PC2"),
                       zaxis = list(title = "PC3")))

# Display the plot
p

```

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(cluster = as.factor(km$cluster))
```

## Profiling

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x = cluster)) +
  geom_bar(fill = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  ggtitle("Distribution Of The Clusters")+
  theme_minimal()



```

Evenly distributed size of each cluster

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x = Total_Purchaase, y = Income, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  ggtitle("Cluster's Profile Based On Income And Spending") +
  xlab("Total Purchase") +
  ylab("Income")+
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Clusters"))+
  theme_minimal()



```

Green is high income while yellow is low income

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x = cluster, y = Total_Purchaase)) +
  geom_point(size = 1,color = "#1f77b7", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = cluster), color = "black", outlier.shape = NA) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  ggtitle("Cluster's Spending Distribution") +
  xlab("Clusters") +
  ylab("Spending")


```

Green have high spending while yellow has low

```{r}
df %>% 
mutate(Total_Promos = AcceptedCmp1 + AcceptedCmp2 + AcceptedCmp3 + AcceptedCmp4 + AcceptedCmp5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Total_Promos, fill = factor(cluster))) +
  geom_bar(position ="dodge", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  ggtitle("Count Of Promotion Accepted") +
  xlab("Number Of Total Accepted Promotions") +
  ylab("Count")


```

The later campaign were most appealed to green cluster

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(cluster), y = NumDealsPurchases, fill = factor(cluster))) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  ggtitle("Number of Deals Purchased") +
  xlab("Clusters") +
  ylab("Number of Deals Purchased")

```

green did not get too many deals

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(cluster) %>% 
  summarise(Wines = mean(MntWines), Fruits = mean(MntFruits), Meat = mean(MntMeatProducts), Fish = mean(MntFishProducts), Sweet = mean(MntSweetProducts), gold = mean(MntGoldProds)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cluster)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Wines, fill = "Wines"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Fruits, fill = "Fruits"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Meat, fill = "Meat"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Fish, fill = "Fish"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = Sweet, fill = "Sweet"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = gold, fill = "Gold"), stat = "identity", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Wines" = "#1F77B4", "Fruits" = "#FF7F0E", "Meat" = "#2CA02C", "Fish" = "#D62728", "Sweet" = "#9467BD", "Gold" = "#8C564B")) +
  labs(title = "Average Spending on Product Categories by Cluster",
       x = "Cluster",
       y = "Average Spending",
       fill = "Type of Product")+
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

green consumes more meat

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(Teenhome, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Red is a parent for sure while green isn't

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(Kidhome, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Green doesn't have kid

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(Family_Size, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Red and Yellow are definitely have family while green and blue seem they don't

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(Age, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(Education, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

No Particular specific conclusion can be drawn

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(Has_Partner, fill = cluster)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#3366CC", "#DC3912", "#FF9900", "#109618")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Red and Yellow have a partner while blue mostly doesn't and nothing conclusive could be said about green.

## Conclusion

### Cluster 1 - Blue

Mostly Single \n Mostly Not a Parent \n Age-wise they are somewhere 30-60 \n Mid to High Income Group

### Cluster 2 - Red

They are parents \n They have a Partner \n Average Income Group \n Are Older

### Cluster 3 - Yellow

Mostly have a partner \n They are parent \n Low Income Group Are \n Younger than other groups (30-40)

### Cluster 4 - Green

Good Proportion of them have a Partner \n Are not Parent \n High Income Group \n Age-wise they are distributed evenly
